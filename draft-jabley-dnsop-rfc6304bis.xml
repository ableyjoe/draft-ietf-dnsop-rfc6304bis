      <t>Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses
        that are not globally-unique.  Examples are the addresses
        designated in RFC 1918 for private use within individual
        sites.</t>

      <t>Devices in such environments may occasionally originate
        Domain Name System (DNS) queries (so-called "reverse lookups")
        corresponding to those private-use addresses. Since the
        addresses concerned have only local significance, it is good
        practice for site administrators to ensure that such queries are
        answered locally. However, it is not uncommon for such queries
        to follow the normal delegation path in the public DNS instead
        of being answered within the site.</t>

      <t>It is not possible for public DNS servers to give
	useful answers to such queries. In addition, due to the
	wide deployment of private-use addresses and the continuing
	growth of the Internet, the volume of such queries is large
	and growing.  The AS112 project aims to provide a distributed
	sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on the
	corresponding authoritative servers.  The AS112 project is
	named after the Autonomous System Number (ASN) that was
	assigned to it.</t>

      <t>RFC6304 described the steps required to install a new AS112
        node, and offered advice relating to such a node's operation.
        This document updates that advice to facilitate the addition
        and removal of zones for which query traffic will be sunk at
        AS112 nodes, using DNAME, whilst still supporting direct
        delegations to AS112 name servers.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4
        addresses that are not globally unique.  Examples are the
        addresses designated in <xref target="RFC1918"/> for private
        use within individual sites.</t>
        
      <t>Devices in such environments may occasionally originate
	Domain Name System (DNS) <xref target="RFC1034"/>
        queries (so-called "reverse lookups") corresponding
	to those private-use addresses. Since the addresses concerned
	have only local significance, it is good practice for site
	administrators to ensure that such queries are answered locally
        <xref target="RFC6303"/>.
	However, it is not uncommon for such queries to follow the
	normal delegation path in the public DNS instead of being
	answered within the site.</t>

      <t>It is not possible for public DNS servers to give
	useful answers to such queries. In addition, due to the
	wide deployment of private-use addresses and the continuing
	growth of the Internet, the volume of such queries is large
	and growing. The AS112 project aims to provide a distributed
	sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on the
	<xref target="RFC5855">IN-ADDR.ARPA authoritative servers</xref>.</t>

      <t>The AS112 project encompasses a loosely coordinated
	collection of independently operated name servers. Each
	name server functions as a single node in an AS112 <xref
	target="RFC4786">anycast cloud</xref>, and
	is configured to answer authoritatively for a particular
	set of nominated zones.</t>

      <t>The AS112 project is named after the Autonomous System
	Number (ASN) that was assigned to it (see <xref
	target="history"/>).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="AS112 DNS Service">
      <section title="Approach">
        <section title="Direct Delegation">
          <t><xref target="RFC6304"/> describes an approach whereby
            zones whose traffic should be directed towards an AS112
            sink should be directly delegated to AS112 name servers.
            Correspondingly, each AS112 node is manually configured
            to answer appropriately for those zones.</t>

	  <t>The guidance in this document preserves this capability
	    for the zones that were originally delegated in this
	    fashion. AS112 nodes that were implemented in accordance
            with the guidance in <xref target="RFC6304"/> will
            continue to provide service for those zones.</t>
	</section>

        <section title="DNAME Redirection">
          <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-as112-dname"/> describes
            a different approach whereby queries towards specific
            zones are redirected to an empty zone also
	    hosted on AS112 servers, using <xref
	    target="RFC6672">DNAME</xref>.</t>

          <t>The guidance in this document introduces this capability,
            allowing any zone administrator to sink query traffic in
            AS112 infrastructure without requiring changes to any
            AS112 node.</t>
	</section>
      </section>

      <section title="Zones" anchor="zones">
	<t>To support Direct Delegation AS112 service, AS112 name
	  servers answer authoritatively for the following zones,
	  corresponding to <xref target="RFC1918"/> private-use

        <t>To aid identification of AS112 anycast nodes, each

      <section title="Nameservers" anchor="name servers">
	<t>To support Direct Delegation AS112 service, the relevant

	  PRISONER.IANA.ORG receives mainly dynamic update queries.</t>

	<t>The addresses of all these name servers are covered by

    <section title="Installation of a New Node">
      <section title="Useful Background Knowledge">
	<t>Installation of an AS112 node is relatively straightforward.
	  However, experience in the following general areas may
	  prove useful:

          <list style="symbols">
	    <t>inter-domain routing with <xref
	      target="RFC4271">BGP</xref>;</t>

            <t>DNS authoritative server operations;</t>

	    <t><xref target="RFC4786">anycast</xref> distribution
	      of DNS services.</t>
	  </list>
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Topological Location">
	<t>AS112 nodes may be located anywhere on the Internet. For
	  nodes that are intended to provide a public service to
	  the Internet community (as opposed to private use), it
	  may well be advantageous to choose a location that is
	  easily (and cheaply) reachable by multiple providers,
	  such as an Internet exchange point.</t>

        <t>AS112 nodes may advertise their service prefix to BGP
          peers for local use (analogous to a conventional peering
          relationship between two providers) or for global use
          (analogous to a customer relationship with one or more
          providers).</t>

        <t>It is good operational practice to notify the community
          of users that may fall within the reach of a new AS112 node
          before it is installed. At an Internet Exchange, local
          mailing lists usually exist to facilitate such announcements.
          For nodes that are intended to be globally reachable,
          coordination with other AS112 operators is highly recommended.
          See also <xref target="communications"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operating System and Host Considerations">
        <t>Examples in this document are based on UNIX and UNIX-like
          operating systems, but other operating systems exist which
          are suitable for use in construction of an AS112 node.</t>

        <t>The chosen platform should include support for either
          cloned loopback interfaces, or the capability to bind
	  multiple addresses to a single loopback interface. The
	  addresses of the name servers listed in <xref
	  target="name servers"/> will be configured on these
	  interfaces in order that the DNS software can respond to
	  queries properly.</t>

        <t>A host that is configured to act as an AS112 anycast
          node should be dedicated to that purpose, and should not be
          used to simultaneously provide other services. This guidance
          is provided due to the unpredictable (and occasionally high)
          traffic levels that AS112 nodes have been seen to attract.</t>

        <t>System startup scripts should be arranged such that the
          various AS112-related components start automatically following
          a system reboot. The order in which interfaces are configured
          and software components started should be arranged such that
          routing software startup follows DNS software startup, and
          DNS software startup follows loopback interface configuration.</t>

        <t>Wrapper scripts or other arrangements should be employed to
          ensure that the anycast service prefix for AS112 is not advertised
          while either the anycast addresses are not configured, or while
          the DNS software is not running.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Routing Software">
        <t>AS112 nodes signal the availability of AS112 name servers
          to the Internet using <xref target="RFC4271">BGP</xref>:
          each AS112 node is a BGP speaker, and announces the prefix
          192.175.48.0/24 to the Internet with origin AS 112 (see also
          <xref target="name servers"/>).</t>

        <t>The examples in this document are based on the
	  <eref target="http://www.quagga.net/">Quagga Routing
	  Suite</eref> running on Linux, but other software packages
	  exist which also provide suitable BGP support for AS112
	  nodes.</t>

	<t>The "bgpd.conf" file is used by Quagga's bgpd daemon, which
	  provides BGP protocol support. The router id in this example
	  is 203.0.113.1; the AS112 node peers with external
	  peers 192.0.2.1 and 192.0.2.2.  Note the local AS number
	  112, and the origination of the prefix 192.175.48.0/24 to
          support Direct Delegation AS112 service; the IPv4 prefix
          TBA and the IPv6 prefix TBA support DNAME Redirection.</t>

      <section title="DNS Software" anchor="dns">
        <t>Although the queries received by AS112 nodes are
          definitively misdirected, it is important that they be
	  answered in a manner that is accurate and consistent.
          For this reason AS112 nodes operate as <xref
          target="RFC1034">fully-functional
          and standards-compliant DNS authoritative servers</xref>,
          and hence require appropriate DNS software.</t>

        <t>Examples in this document are based on
	  <eref target="http://www.isc.org/software/BIND/">ISC
	  BIND9</eref>, but other DNS software exists which is
	  suitable for use in construction of an AS112 node.</t>

	<t>The following is a sample BIND9 "named.conf" file for a
	  dedicated AS112 server. Note that the name server is
	  configured to act as an authoritative-only server (i.e.
	  recursion is disabled).  The name server is also configured
	  to listen on the various AS112 anycast name server addresses,
	  as well as its local addresses.</t>

	<t>The BIND9 tool "dig" can be used to retrieve the TXT

	  and "HOSTNAME.AS112.ARPA", directed at one of the AS112
	  anycast name server addresses.  Continuing the example

        <t>If the response received indicates a different node is being
          used, then there is probably a routing problem to solve. If
          there is no response received at all, there might be host
          or name server problem. Judicious use of tools such as
          traceroute, and consultation of BGP looking glasses might
          be useful in troubleshooting.</t>

        <t>Note that an appropriate set of tests for a new server will
          include queries sent from many different places within the
          expected service area of the node, using both UDP and TCP
          transport, and exercising all three AS112 anycast name server
          addresses.</t>

    <section title="Operations">
      <section title="Monitoring">
        <t>AS112 nodes should be monitored to ensure they are functioning
          correctly, just as with any other production service. An AS112
          node that stops answering queries correctly can cause failures
          and timeouts in unexpected places and can lead to failures in
          dependent systems that can be difficult to troubleshoot.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Downtime">
        <t>An AS112 node that needs to go off-line (e.g. for planned
          maintenance or as part of the diagnosis of some problem)
          should stop advertising the AS112 service prefix to its BGP
          peers. This can be done by shutting down the routing software
          on the node altogether or by causing the routing system to
          withdraw the route.</t>

        <t>Withdrawing the service prefix is important in order to avoid
          blackholing query traffic in the event that the DNS software on
          the node is not functioning normally.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Statistics and Measurement">
        <t>Use of the AS112 node should be measured in order to track
          long-term trends, identify anomalous conditions, and to ensure
          that the configuration of the AS112 node is sufficient to handle
          the query load.</t>

        <t>Examples of free monitoring tools that might be useful to
          operators of AS112 nodes include:

          <list style="symbols">

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Communications" anchor="communications">
      <t>It is good operational practice to notify the community
        of users that may fall within the reach of a new AS112 node
        before it is installed. At Internet Exchanges, local
        mailing lists usually exist to facilitate such announcements.</t>

      <t>For nodes that are intended to be globally reachable,
	coordination with other AS112 operators is especially
	recommended.  The mailing list <eref
	target="mailto:as112-ops@lists.dns-oarc.net"/> is operated
	for this purpose.</t>

      <t>Information pertinent to AS112 operations is maintained
        at <eref target="http://www.as112.net/"/>.</t>

      <t>Information about an AS112 node should also be published within
	the DNS, within the "HOSTNAME.AS112.NET" and "HOSTNAME.AS112.ARPA"
	zones. See <xref target="dns"/> for more details.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="On the Future of AS112 Nodes">
      <t>It is recommended practice for the operators of recursive
	name servers to answer queries for zones served by AS112
	nodes locally, such that queries never have an opportunity
	to reach AS112 servers <xref target="RFC6303"/>. Operational
	experience with AS112 nodes does not currently indicate an
	observable trend towards compliance with those recommendations,
	however.</t>

      <t>It is expected that some DNS software vendors will include
	default configuration that will implement measures such as
	those described in <xref target="RFC6303"/>.  If such
	software is widely deployed, it is reasonable to assume
	that the query load received by AS112 nodes will decrease;
	however, it is safe to assume that the query load will not
	decrease to zero, and consequently that AS112 nodes will
	continue to provide a useful service for the foreseeable
	future.</t>

      <t>The use of DNAME Redirection to provide AS112 service is
        new, and hence is informed by minimal operational experience.
        The use of DNAME means that queries for many source zones
        could be redirected to AS112 infrastructure with no real
        opportunity for coordination.</t>

      <t>If successful, and in the absence of operational concerns,
	the community might well recommend the retirement of the
	original Direct Delegation AS112 service, with equivalent
	service for the zones concerned instead provided using DNAME
	Redirection. This document makes no such recommendation,
	however.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The name servers associated with Direct Delegation AS112
        service are all named under the domain
        IANA.ORG (see <xref target="name servers"/>). However,
        the anycast infrastructure itself is operated by a
        loosely-coordinated, diverse mix of organisations across
        the Internet, and is not an IANA function.</t>

      <t>The autonomous system number 112 and the IPv4 prefix
        192.175.48.0/24 were assigned by ARIN.</t>

      <t>The IPv4 prefix TBA and the IPv6 prefix TBA, used for
        DNAME Redirection AS112 service, were assigned by the IANA
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-as112-dname"/>.</t>

      <t>This document has no IANA actions.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Hosts should never normally send queries to AS112 servers;
	queries relating to private-use addresses should be answered
	locally within a site. Hosts that send queries to AS112
	servers may well leak information relating to private
	infrastructure to the public network, and this could present
	a security risk. This risk is orthogonal to the presence
	or absence of authoritative servers for these zones in the
	public DNS infrastructure, however.</t>

      <t>Queries that are answered by AS112 servers are usually
	unintentional; it follows that the responses from AS112
	servers are usually unexpected. Unexpected inbound traffic
	can trigger intrusion detection systems or alerts by
	firewalls. Operators of AS112 servers should be prepared
	to be contacted by operators of remote infrastructure who
        believe their security has been violated. Advice to those
	who mistakenly believe that responses from AS112 nodes
	constitutes an attack on their infrastructure can be found
	in <xref target="RFC6305"/>.</t>

      <t>The deployment of AS112 nodes is very loosely coordinated
	compared to other services distributed using anycast. The
	malicious compromise of an AS112 node and subversion of the
	data served by the node is hence more difficult to detect
	due to the lack of central management. Since it is conceivable
	that changing the responses to queries received by AS112
	nodes might influence the behaviour of the hosts sending
	the queries, such a compromise might be used as an attack
	vector against private infrastructure.</t>

      <t>Operators of AS112 should take appropriate measures to
        ensure that AS112 nodes are appropriately protected from
        compromise, such as would normally be employed for production
        name server or network infrastructure. The guidance provided
        for root name servers in <xref target="RFC2870"/> may be
        instructive.</t>

      <t>The zones hosted by AS112 servers are not signed with
        DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/>. Given the distributed
        and loosely-coordinated structure of the AS112 service,
        the zones concerned could only be signed if the private
        key material used was effectively public, obviating any
        security benefit resulting from the use of those keys.</t>

    <section title="History" anchor="history">
      <t>Widespread use of the private address blocks listed in
	<xref target="RFC1918"/> followed that document's publication
	in 1996.  At that time the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone was served by
	root servers.</t>

     <t>The idea of off-loading IN-ADDR.ARPA queries relating to
       <xref target="RFC1918"/> addresses from the root name servers
       was first proposed by Bill Manning and John Brown.</t>

     <t>The use of anycast for distributing authoritative DNS service
       for <xref target="RFC1918"/> IN-ADDR.ARPA zones was subsequently
       proposed at a private meeting of root server operators.</t>

     <t>ARIN provided an IPv4 prefix for the anycast service and
       also the autonomous system number 112 for use in originating
       that prefix.  This assignment gave the project its name.</t>

     <t>In 2002, the first AS112 anycast nodes were deployed.</t>

     <t>In 2011, the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone was redelegated from the
       root servers to a new set of servers operated independently
       by AfriNIC, APNIC, ARIN, ICANN, LACNIC, and the RIPE NCC and
       named according to <xref target="RFC5855"/>.</t>

     <t><xref target="RFC6304"/>, the precursor to this document,
       was published in July 2011.</t>

     <t>The use of anycast name servers in the AS112 project contributed
       to the operational experience of anycast DNS services, and
       it can be seen as a precursor to the anycast distribution
       of other authoritative DNS servers in subsequent years (e.g.,
       various root servers).</t>
